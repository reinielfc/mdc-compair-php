      <h1>About Us</h1>

      <p> Started in 2012, by father Orlando and son Ronaldo Hernandez, CompAir was founded with one mission in mind; to provide a
      better service, at a lower price. Family-owned and operated, we understand the frustration of having our appliances shut
      down at the worst time possible. That is why we are committed to offering emergency services 24/7, or (if the problem is
      bad enough) temporary replacements, all so that the comfort of your life is not immediately stopped by a minor
      inconvenience. </p>
      <p> We pride ourselves with providing an individualized service for each and every customer. We believe that each presents a
      unique opportunity for a lasting business relationship, and as such they deserve special attention and quality results.
      Whether you need a new AC installed, or your refrigerator stopped running, or the water heater is not doing its job, we
      are prepared to deal with all of it with skill and professionalism. If you live in the areas of Kendall, Coral Gables,
      Doral, Palmetto Bay, or other surrounding areas, just <em><strong>give us a call</strong></em> and we will send you the right
      person for the job. Choose CompAir and rest easy knowing that you will have your desired level of comfort in no time. </p>
