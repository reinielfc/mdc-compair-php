        <p style="color: red">I submitted by mistake without finishing the comment:</p>

          <li>Link to video: <a href="https://youtu.be/1jYklMIJqJM">https://youtu.be/1jYklMIJqJM</a></li>
          <li>Link to website: <a href="https://reyfdz96.github.io/CompAir">https://reyfdz96.github.io/CompAir</a></li>
          <li>Link to Github repository: <a href="https://github.com/reyfdz96/CompAir">https://github.com/reyfdz96/CompAir</a></li>
          <li>Attached is the website (just in case something fails).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>A few things about this assignment:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>I didn't follow the rubric in regards to the logo, I used an SVG file instead of PNG or JPG, I used it
            because it makes the image look better.</li>
          <li>Also I don't believe I meet the size requirement, or maybe I did? Because an SVG can be of any size and
            look the same.</li>
          <li>I merged the logo with the title of the website. I hope that's okay.</li>
          <li>You'll also notice that some of the links in the nav bar don't work, that's because they're supposed to
          link you to a section in the services page.</li>
          <li>I didn't follow the CSS in the assignment exactly, I modified it a little bit and I might need to organize
          it better later on. I was experimenting a lot, I'm a bit rusty on it.</li>
        </ol>
        <p style="color: red">The only thing added is the link to the video.</p>
      </div>
